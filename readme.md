## Thoughts

This was a fun project for me. I remember back in the day, I used to use a program on my computer called WinAmp to listen to music. This took me back to those days, creating a music player. I don't know how useful this is today, with things like Spotify or Pandora.

There are a few features I can think to add to this project, like adding shuffle or volume features. Its interesting how easy this project actually was. You woul think that making a music player like this would be complicated, but it really wasn't.
